## Dockerfile:

- The Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions needed to create a new container image

- We can use below command in docker file and use capital letters only for the instruction for docker file.

```
FROM                   FROM ubuntu:18.04, FROM base_image				 	                        
RUN                    execute the code, command								               
MAINTAINER             Author, owner, from (not mandatory)						              
COPY                   to copy file from local to docker container or vice versa.				               
ADD                    zip file to copy and extract the zip. It will extract only the .tar, .tar.gz format only.         
EXPOSE                 to expose the port							                    
WORKDIR                to set the working directory in container	                                                                 
ENTRYPOINT             it is like cmd. On some file cmd and entrypoint both commands will be there on     priority, entry command will execute first.								               
CMD                    during creation of container which command can run, those command define in cmd 
ENV                    to create environment variable.
```

## Command to execute the docker file. Need to provide the path where your docker file has placed		

(Below it will create your custom image with ‘my_image’ name. after that you can make container from that custom image.)
```
docker build -t my_image .										
docker build -t my_image /path/to/dockerfile
```

## Below are the sample Dockerfile:

- dockerfile for the ubuntu image.
```
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2
RUN echo "ServerName localhost" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
RUN service apache2 restart
COPY index.html /var/www/html
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND" ]
RUN echo "ServerName localhost" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

## Dockefile for the java application.

```
# Use a RHEL or CentOS base image
FROM centos:8

# Install OpenJDK
RUN yum install -y java-11-openjdk-headless

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file into the container
COPY target/your-java-app.jar /app/your-java-app.jar

# Expose the port your application runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run your application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "your-java-app.jar"]
```
