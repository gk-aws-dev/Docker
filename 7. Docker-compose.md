## Docker-Compose

- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

- Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

- docker compose used ```docker-compose.yaml/yml``` file where we define the all steps.

- YAML storing date in key-values pair. ```<key>``` represent name and ```<value>``` represent name. (<key>: <value> here space is mandatory)

- Below is the exanple of the simple docker-compose file

```
version: '3'
services:
  tomcat-img:
    image: 'tomcat'
    ports:
    - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
    - "/opt/docker:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps"
```
## Docker-compose Installation:

- To download and install Compose standalone:

```curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.5/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose```

- Apply executable permissions to the standalone binary in the target path for the installation.

```chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose```

you can refer the documentation as well - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/

## Docker-compose command:

•	To run compose-file: ```docker-compose -f <compose-file> options servicename```

•	To create/start container: ```docker-compose up```

•	To start in detach mode: ```docker-compose up -d```

•	To start specific service: ```docker-compose up -f <servicename>```

•	To list container: ```docker-compose ps <service>```

•	To stop-remove container: ```docker-compose down```

•	List images: ```docker-compose images```

•	Build services: ```docker-compose build <servicename>```

•	View output of container: ```docker-compose logs -f <service>```

•	Stop services: ```docker-compose stop <sevicename>```

•	Stop and Remove container: ```docker-compose rm <servicename>```

•	Execute commands in a running container: ```docker-compose exec <service> <command>```
                                           ```docker exec -it <docker-httpd-web-1> bash```

•	Execute commands in a running container detach mode: ```docker-compose exec -d …```

•	Scaling container: ```docker-compose up -d --scale service=num```
