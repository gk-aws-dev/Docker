# DOCKER:

•	Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 

•	Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 

•	With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

•	By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## What is Docker:

- Containerization is the concept and docker implement the containerization.

- ***Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications***, which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and push these containers to container registries such as Docker Hub, Quay.io and so on.
  
- ***In simple words, you can understand as containerization is a concept or technology and Docker Implements Containerization.***

## Docker- Architect:

- The above picture clearly indicates that Docker Deamon is brain of Docker. If Docker Deamon is killed, stops working for some reasons, Docker is brain dead :p (sarcasm intended).

- There are three important things,

1.	**docker build** -> builds docker images from Dockerfile.
2.	**docker run** -> runs container from docker images.
3.	**docker push** -> push the container image to public/private registries to share the docker images.

-	Docker file is the set of instructions, that we are executing in the docker daemon to create the ubuntu base image. Docker image can be run once the docker run command and again create the docker container. And we can share this container to anybody.

-	The Docker client (CLI) and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface.
