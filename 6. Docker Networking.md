- Container networking refers to the ability for containers to connect to and communicate with each other, or to non-Docker workloads.

## Bridge network: (default network)

- This is the default network created when Docker is installed.
  
- Containers connected to a bridge network can communicate with each other and with the external network. Bridge networks are isolated from the host network by default.
  
- in bridge network – the network for the container and the host is the different. They are connecting with each other with the virtual network (veth) that called as ```docker0```.


## Host Networking: 

- Containers connected to the host network share the host's networking namespace. This means they can access services running on the host's network directly without network address translation (NAT).

- Example: If you have a containerized application that needs to listen on a specific port and be accessible on the host's network without port mapping, you can use the host network mode.
  
- No need of the port mapping in the host network, container will take the host port. Less secure as container using the host network. WARNING: Published ports are discarded when using host network mode.

- ```docker run -d --name <container-name> --network=host ubuntu:latest``` –> when we using this command to attach the container to host you can see below the there is no assigned ip address as its binding with the host.

## Custom bridge network: 

- we can make own defined network as well in Docker.

```
docker run -it --name container1 ubuntu bash
docker run -it --name container2 ubuntu bash (make two container and check this will be by default in the bridge network)
docker network ls
docker network rm <network-name>
docker network create <network-name>
```
to assign to network to the new container: ```docker network connect <network-name> <container>```

also, we can use this command as well: 
```
docker run -d --name <container-name> --network=<network-name> ubuntu:latest
docker network connect <network-name> <container> (to disconnect the network, then container will go in the default bridge network)
```

## Overlay network:

- This mode enables communication between containers across multiple Docker host machines, allowing containers to be connected to a single network even when they are running on different hosts.
